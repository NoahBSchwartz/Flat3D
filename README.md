# 3D-Screen-Illusion
- TLDR:
This project earned first place in the TSA Software Development Competition. It gives the illusion of wearing 3D glasses with nothing but a laptop. 

- Process:
I used Mediapipe to track the user's face in real-time (https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html). These coordinates were then fed into a Blender scene. The camera simply had to move in sync with the user's movements for a convincing effect. The final piece was some post-processing to give the parallax effect.
